# randomslide v0.2A
Generate random slides for online presentation.

## Created by
Bj√∂rn W Naucler (bwn@randomslide.com)  
Morgan Andersson (ma@randomslide.com)

## Dependencies
[BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) & [bcrypt](https://golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)  
The code has been tested on Arch Linux 5.5 and FreeBSD 12, but should be fairly portable.

## Project purpose
Slideshow karaokae or other pranks. Actual real world usefullness can be questioned.

## Installation
```
go get github.com/boltdb/bolt
go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
go get github.com/bnaucler/randomslide
```

`bin/build.sh all` to build server and tools.  

## Usage
Launch with `bin/rsserver`  
You can also use `bin/rsmonitor.sh` to automatically restart the server.

Output of `bin/rsserver -h`:  
```
Usage of bin/rsserver:
  -d string
    	specify database to open (default "./data/rs.db")
  -p int
    	port number to listen (default 6291)
  -v	verbose mode
```

Server log files can be accessed at `static/logs` or in the admin interface.

## CLI tools
`dbdump` will, perhaps unsurprisingly, dump the database to console. Not recommended with large data sets, but useful when troubleshooting.  
`batchimport` can import a UTF-8-encoded text file as text objects directly into the database.
